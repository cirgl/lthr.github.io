Not really just the most frequently used commands of Bash, but more a list of thing I found beneficial at some point. Thing I know I'd need to reuse again later.

```
CTRL e          Move cursor to end of line
CTRL a          Move cursor to beginning of line
CTRL u          Delete from cursor until beginning of line
CTRL k          Delete from cursor until end of line
CTRL l          Clear screen
pwd             Current directory name
ssh             Log on to a different server
scp             Copy files across servers
```

Rename all png files in a directory, add `_test` to the filename:

```
for file in *.png; do mv "$file" "${file/.png/_test.png}"; done
```
To remove `_test` from the filename, do this:

```
for file in *.png; do mv "$file" "${file/_test.png/.png}"; done
```

## grep
Find the line with two words, when you know the order of the words in the line:

```
echo 11 tests, 4 failures | grep 'test.*failure'
```
Find multiple words:

```
echo 11 tests, 4 failures | grep -E 'test|failure'
```

Find word(s) in a file:

```
grep "some words" some-file.log
```

## curl
Get source code from url:

```
curl -s http://ap-advtool1s:8080/
```


## sed
Replace. Add line breaks to output between each '><' in url source:

```
curl -s http://ap-advtool1s:8080/ | sed 's/></>\n</g'
```


## curl/sed/grep
Get lines containing both a style and a class tag from url source:

```
curl -s http://ap-advtool1s:8080/ | sed 's/></>\n</g' | grep style= | grep class=
```


## if else
When running scripts with arguments, make sure first argument is provided:

````
if [[ $1 != "" ]] 
then 
    echo Argument provided
else 
    echo Argument missing!
fi
```


## Remove from beginning and end of a multiple-line output
To demonstrate, we use the command `git remote -v` (from inside a git repository), which will output two lines:

```
git remote -v
# origin http://server.git (fetch)
# origin http://server.git (push)
```

We pipe the output, grep the line containing the word `push`, and remove 'origin ' and ' (push)' from it with `sed`:

```
git remote -v | grep push | sed -e 's/origin //g' -e 's/ (push)//g'
# http://server.git
```
